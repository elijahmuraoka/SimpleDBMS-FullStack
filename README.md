# Simple DBMS Full-Stack Demo

This is a full-stack demo application that demonstrates CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality using a MySQL database, with a working frontend made from HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The backend is built using Node.js and Express, and the communication between the frontend and backend is done using Fetch API and REST API format. The app allows the user to add a new person to the database by providing a name, edit the name of an existing user in the database, or delete a user. The app interface provides a simple way to manipulate users directly through the web interface.
